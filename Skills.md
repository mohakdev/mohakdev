# Skills I want to possess as a Developer

I want to learn the **.NET Ecosystem** because it is developed by **Microsoft** and we can build almost anything with it. Also **.NET** mostly uses **C#** a language which i already know a little bit.
So I want my primary programming language to be **C#**.

That means I will work mostly on C# from now on. 

One of my *previous mistake* was to learn a lot of languages. This was great because I got to know so many languages but I also wasted a lot of time. So from now on I will work mostly in
**C#**

Thing we can do with **C#**

- Make Mobile apps with **Xamarin**
- Make Desktop apps with **WPF**
- Make Web Apps with **ASP.NET**
- Make Games with **Unity** *(Which I am currently doing)*
- And Much More.

One more thing I want to learn is **Web Development**. Now I already know Web Developement basics but even that was *5-4 years ago*. I have completely forgot everything.
Now I can revise **HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT** again. Once I know that I can easily learn the backend with **ASP.NET** as it uses **C#** 

Doing this will leave me many options in future as I can go in any direction I want to, except **Web3** and all that shit which I am not that interested in anyways.
